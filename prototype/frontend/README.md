### Frontend Setup

1. Download the frontend folder.
2. As the frontend is developed using React and JavaScript, download all necessary packages by navigating to the frontend directory and execute:
```
npm install
```
3. Launch the frontend by executing:
```
npm start
```

Please note that to utilize the frontend, the server must also be running concurrently.
