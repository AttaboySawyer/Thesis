# Example IPYNB

NOTE: It has come to my attention that the example.ipynb may not be downloadable from Github due to file size, so I have uploaded the identical file to Google Colab which displays the code and results in the same form as the example ipynb would if downloaded. Please view the Colab notebook through the following link:

If you wish to run it yourself, it will require the python libraries to be downloaded on you machine and all datasets and pretrained network paths to be updated on your machine, but in this form you can clearly see the preprocessing and results process without having to run it yourself.

The example ipynb file walks through the process of how the networks are trained and put together, how the data is preprocessed with visualization, and how the results are acheived. So long as the dataset paths are pointed to the right locations, this should run, and you should also be able to see my past run of the notebook with all outputs.

The results acheived in the written thesis were acheived using the saved network located in the exerimental source code folder, but the training and testing processes were exactly the same as in this exmaple. The results may vary slightly as this example generates a newly trained base network, so the training my be slightly different.
