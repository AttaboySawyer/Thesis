# Datasets and Downloads
Download the datasets and models, then update the pathing wthin the ipynb or source code where necccesary. If you are not using segmentation masks or bounding boxes, you do not need to provide the correct paths.

## Pre-trained models

Segmentation mask augmentation model checkpoints: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bLtCzB8wUt1UL669o6xywpcsQ6ftZSQq?usp=share_link
- to be used during preprocessing when the segmentation mask augmentation is needed

Bounding box augmentation model: https://drive.google.com/file/d/11scF8Ax7ht243NfJrDQYxUojLW7jYLUF/view?usp=share_link
- to be used during preprocessing when the bounding box augmentation is needed

Base network model: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xDk582ywqZRQZ9AbpNRtd0R79bFS4SAT/view?usp=share_link
- to be used when setting up the SNN. Instead of training a new model, just provide the path to this one
