# Example IPYNB

Welcome to the Example IPYNB section. Below is a link to access the Google Colab hosted example.ipynb file, or you can download the file from this directory, which provides a comprehensive walkthrough of our project's implementation and results. Please note that due to the size of the code block output windows, you may need to scroll to the very bottom of some ouptuts to view the results, like for the accuracy of the final trained networks as an example.

## Access the Example IPYNB

**Note**: Due to file size limitations on Github, the example.ipynb file may not be directly downloadable. However, you can access an identical version hosted on Google Colab, which displays the code and results in the same format as the example.ipynb file would if downloaded.

## Usage Instructions

If you wish to run the example.ipynb file yourself, please ensure that you have the necessary Python libraries installed on your machine. Additionally, you will need to update all dataset and pre-trained network paths to the appropriate locations.

The example.ipynb file walks through the following processes:
- Training and assembly of the networks
- Preprocessing of data with visualization
- Achievement of results

As long as the dataset paths are correctly pointed to the right locations, the notebook should run smoothly. You will also be able to view past runs of the notebook with all outputs.

Please note that while the results achieved in the written thesis were based on the saved network located in the experimental source code folder, the training and testing processes were exactly the same as in this example. However, the results may vary slightly as this example generates a newly trained base network, resulting in slight differences in training.

Feel free to explore the example.ipynb file for a detailed understanding of our project implementation and results. If you encounter any issues or have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out.
