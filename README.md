# Thesis Directory
Welcome, this is the repository for all experiments, examples, dataset links, and the prototype/server source code. Below is a brief explaination of the contents of each folder. Please read the README file in each folder for further details and explaination of running the code.

## Datasets folder
The readme in this fodler contains links to the old SNN training dataset, the base network training dataset, and the snn training dataset. The sets are too large to be uploaded to Github, so please download them and change the config file paths to point to the appropriate dataset, or if runnning the example, change the paths within the ipynb file.

## Example
This folder contains the example ipynb and explainations for the process and how the results are gotten.

## Experimental Source code
This folder contains all the source code used for the creating, training and testing of all netowrks, includeing the bounding box network, the segmentation mask network, the old SNN network, the proper base network, and the proper SNN.

## Prototype
This folder contains the source code for the frontend and the server for the prototype.
