# Example IPYNB
The example ipynb file walks through the process of how the networks are trained and put together, how the data is preprocessed with visualization, and how the results are acheived. So long as the dataset paths are pointed to the right locations, this should run, and you should also be able to see my past run of the notebook with all outputs.

NOTE: The results acheived in the written thesis were acheived using the saved network located in the exerimental source code folder, but th etraining and testing processes were exactly the same as in this exmaple. The results may vary slightly as this example generates a newly trained base network, so the training my be slightly different.
