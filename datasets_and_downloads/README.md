# Datasets and Downloads

Welcome to the Datasets and Downloads section. Below are links to download datasets and pre-trained models necessary for the project. Ensure to update the pathing within your IPython notebook or source code where necessary after downloading.

## Pre-trained Models

### Segmentation Mask Augmentation Model Checkpoints
Download the segmentation mask augmentation model checkpoints from the following link: [Segmentation Mask Augmentation Model Checkpoints](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bLtCzB8wUt1UL669o6xywpcsQ6ftZSQq?usp=share_link).
- These checkpoints are to be utilized during preprocessing when segmentation mask augmentation is required.

### Bounding Box Augmentation Model
Download the bounding box augmentation model from the following link: [Bounding Box Augmentation Model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11scF8Ax7ht243NfJrDQYxUojLW7jYLUF/view?usp=share_link).
- This model is to be used during preprocessing when bounding box augmentation is needed.

### Base Network Model
Download the base network model from the following link: [Base Network Model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xDk582ywqZRQZ9AbpNRtd0R79bFS4SAT/view?usp=share_link).
- This model is intended for use in setting up the Siamese Neural Network (SNN). Instead of training a new model, simply provide the path to this pre-trained model.

## Datasets

### Base Network Training Dataset
Download the base network training dataset from the following link: [Base Network Training Dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_gEjWIgB0NcuFIfAJ6xXY6GxZFLewWB6?usp=share_link).

### Siamese Network Training Dataset (Including Old SNN Training)
