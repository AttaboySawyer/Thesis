## Experimental source code for early networks, and experimentations

This repository houses initial endeavors in training and evaluating the Siamese neural network, the bounding box network, and segmentation mask models. It serves as a publicly accessible repository for code snippets referenced within the written thesis. Please note that this repository is not intended for practical use as a functioning example of the networks or platform.

For a comprehensive and functional implementation of the neural network, kindly refer to the .ipynb file located in the "example" directory. For the platform, please consult the contents of the "prototype" directory.
